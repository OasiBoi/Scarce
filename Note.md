# Note:

This is the first not-even-prototype version of the game:
### EVERYTHING IS TRASH

This version has trash camera controls:
The camera is too sensitive, the camera vertically orbits all the way around the player when prompted while the player is facing opposite to their starting rotation (I haven't figured out why this happens), and the camera jerks when reaching its rotational limits.
- it uses the old unity input system, there will be a version in the future using the new input system
- also i need a new controller to test the game with

### ANY AND ALL HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED
